Finance Research
===========================

This project contains the basis of the exploratory research I did as part of my undergraduate research during
the summer of 2013. The purpose of the research was to better understand the impact of the short-selling 
activities of high frequency traders and the effect of the short-selling ban during the recent financial crisis.
